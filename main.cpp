/// This file contains the main() function for the ramfuzz executable, the
/// RamFuzz code generator.  This executable scans C++ files for class
/// declarations and produces test code that can create random objects of these
/// classes.  The invocation syntax is
///
/// ramfuzz <input file> ... -- [<clang option> ...]
///
/// On success, it outputs two files: fuzz.hpp and fuzz.cpp.  They contain the
/// generated test code.  Users #include fuzz.hpp to get the requisite
/// declarations; they compile fuzz.cpp to get an object file with the
/// definitions.  The generator assumes the input files are #includable headers,
/// and fuzz.hpp #includes each of the input files to access the class
/// declarations in the generated code.
///
/// After the "--" argument, ramfuzz takes clang options necessary to parse the
/// input files.  These typically include -I, -std, and -xc++ (to force .h files
/// to be treated as C++ instead of C).
///
/// (TODO: why is "--" necessary?  We should be able to take all relevant
/// options directly.)
///
/// For every class in an input file (but not in other headers #included from
/// input files), it generates a _control class_ in the ramfuzz namespace.  The
/// control class is in charge of creating an instance of the class under test
/// and invoking its methods with random parameter values.  The control class is
/// named to encode the fully qualified name of the class under test.  For
/// example, if the class under test is a::b::C, then the control class will be
/// named ramfuzz::rfa_b_C::control.  See test/namespace.cpp for real-life
/// examples.
///
/// The control class has one method for each public non-static method of the
/// class under test.  The control method, when invoked, generates random
/// arguments and invokes the corresponding method under test.  Control methods
/// take no arguments, as they are self-contained and generate parameter values
/// internally.  The control class also has a constructor that constructs the
/// object under test using any one of its public constructors.  So a random
/// object under test may be obtained by constructing the control class and then
/// randomly invoking its methods to exercise the under-test instance.  This is
/// called spinning the method roulette.  See method gen::make() in
/// runtime/ramfuzz-rt.hpp for an example of this process.
///
/// Exit code is 0 on success, 1 on a Clang-reported error, and 2 if more input
/// is needed to generate full testing code.  For explanation of 2, consider
/// this code on input:
///
/// class Foo;
/// struct Bar { void process_foo(Foo& foo); };
///
/// Upon seeing the process_foo() declaration, ramfuzz will generate code to
/// exercise this method with a random Foo value.  But that code will reference
/// Foo's control class ramfuzz::rfFoo::control.  If ramfuzz doesn't see Foo's
/// definition, its control class will never get generated, so Bar's control
/// will fail to compile with an error like "use of undeclared identifier
/// 'rfFoo'".  Since ramfuzz keeps track of whether Foo's control is generated
/// or not, it can detect this situation and return the exit code 2 to warn the
/// user that the generated code is incomplete.  In that case, ramfuzz will also
/// print to standard error a list of classes whose controls are missing.
///
/// Keep in mind that ramfuzz only generates code for its input files and not
/// for other files #included from them.  It is thus possible to get exit status
/// 2 if Foo's definition exists but is #included.  The remedy is to add Foo's
/// header to the list of ramfuzz input files.
